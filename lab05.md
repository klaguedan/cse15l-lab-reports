Dec. 3, 2022

In this lab report, Part 1 will go over an imaginary debugging scenario and Part 2 will be a reflection on what I've learned this second half of the quarter.

## 1️⃣ Debugging Scenario

## 2️⃣ Reflection

Something I didn't know before was vim! I didn't know that there existed a tool that allowed us to edit files directly from the terminal. Although finicky at times, I see the value in vim when working on remote servers and in general, there were many helpful commands I learned that made editing a file or a script faster. Of course, it doesn't replace the convenience of using a normal text editor or IDE, but vim is helpful as a backup plan. Related, I think it was cool to see that vim had a built in vimtutor module to learn and practice using vim.
