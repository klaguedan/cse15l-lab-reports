# Lab Report 5 - Putting it All Together

Dec. 3, 2022

In this lab report, Part 1 will go over an imaginary debugging scenario and Part 2 will be a reflection on what I've learned this second half of the quarter.

<br>

## 1Ô∏è‚É£üßÄ Debugging Scenario

First, a quick summary of what the student is trying to achieve. The student's objective will be to run the bash script `reverse-cheese.sh` with a string as an argument. The bash script and the `ReverseCheese.java` will search for cheeses in `cheese.txt` that match the string and reverse all the characters in that cheese. The results should show a `Regular` and `Reversed` cheese.

**STUDENT:** Hello! Whenever I run `reverse-cheese.sh` with a valid string argument, the correct cheeses are shown but they do not seem to be reversing correctly. I'm not sure which part of the code (script, java file, text file) is responsible for this.

**TA:** Indeed, the `Regular:` output all seems right but the strings aren't reversing like how we'd like them. Which file and method are responsible for reversing the strings? I would recommend taking a closer look there and using `jdb` to notice any suspicious variable values. You may find some useful clues there. Best of luck!

The file containing the method that does the actual reversing of the cheeses is `ReverseCheese.java`.

The method in this file that reverses is `reverse()`. The student now proceeds to use `jdb` to inspect this part of the code.

```bash
$ javac -g ReverseCheese.java
$ jdb ReverseCheese "Vermont Cheddar Cheese"

Initializing jdb ...
> stop at ReverseCheese:29 # Stops before the string is reversed
Deferring breakpoint ReverseCheese:29.
It will be set after the class is loaded.

> run
run ReverseCheese "Vermont Cheddar Cheese"
Set uncaught java.lang.Throwable
Set deferred uncaught java.lang.Throwable
>
VM Started: Set deferred breakpoint ReverseCheese:29

Breakpoint hit: "thread=main", ReverseCheese.main(), line=29 bci=4
29        String inputReversed = reverse(userInput);
```

Taking a closer look at the value of all variables when `reverse()` is called. Of particular note is the variable `toReverse[]` because it is a variable within the `reverse()` method that contains the elements of the input string that will be reversed.

```bash
main[1] locals
Method arguments:
args = instance of java.lang.String[1] (id=525)
Local variables:
userInput = "Vermont Cheddar Cheese"


# Execute the next line which is splitting the string
# into elements to be reversed
main[1] step
>
Step completed: "thread=main", ReverseCheese.reverse(), line=14 bci=0
14        String[] toReverse = userInput.split(" ");


# Variable still not assigned, but one more step should do
# the trick
main[1] locals
Method arguments:
userInput = "Vermont Cheddar Cheese"
Local variables:


# Calls the reverse() method on the cheese
main[1] step
>
Step completed: "thread=main", ReverseCheese.reverse(), line=16 bci=7
16        for (int i=0; i < toReverse.length/2; i++) {

# "toReverse" exists now but locals cannot print its contents
main[1] locals
Method arguments:
userInput = "Vermont Cheddar Cheese"
Local variables:
toReverse = instance of java.lang.String[3] (id=528)

# View contents of "toReverse." This array does not
# contain the right values!
main[1] dump toReverse
 toReverse = {
"Vermont", "Cheddar", "Cheese"
}
main[1] exit

Regular:  Vermont Cheddar Cheese
Reversed: CheeseCheddarVermont
```

We expect the values in `toReverse[]` to be individual letters, not entire words. Thus, there must be something wrong with how the array is assigned its elements.

In Line 14 of  `ReverseCheese.java`, the `split()` method is used on `userInput` to help assign elements to `toReverse[]`.

```java
String[] toReverse = userInput.split(" ");
```

The bug is that there is an extra space in the `split()` argument when there should be none!


## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Reflection

Something I didn't know before was vim! I didn't know that there existed a tool that allowed us to edit files directly from the terminal. Although finicky at times, I see the value in vim when working on remote servers and in general, there were many helpful commands I learned that made editing a file or a script faster. Of course, it doesn't replace the convenience of using a normal text editor or IDE, but vim is helpful as a backup plan. Related, I think it was cool to see that vim had a built in vimtutor module to learn and practice using vim.
