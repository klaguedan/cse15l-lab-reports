# Lab Report 5 - Putting it All Together

Dec. 3, 2022

In this lab report, Part 1 will go over an imaginary debugging scenario and Part 2 will be a reflection on what I've learned this second half of the quarter.

## 1️⃣ Debugging Scenario

First, a quick summary of what the student is trying to achieve. The student's objective will be to run the bash script `reverse-cheese.sh` with a string as an argument. The bash script and the `ReverseCheese.java` will search for cheeses in `cheese.txt` that match the string and reverse all the characters in that cheese. The results should show a `Regular` and `Reversed` cheese.

---

Student: Whenever I run `reverse-cheese.sh` with a valid string argument, the correct cheeses are shown cheeses do not seem to be reversed correctly.

## 2️⃣ Reflection

Something I didn't know before was vim! I didn't know that there existed a tool that allowed us to edit files directly from the terminal. Although finicky at times, I see the value in vim when working on remote servers and in general, there were many helpful commands I learned that made editing a file or a script faster. Of course, it doesn't replace the convenience of using a normal text editor or IDE, but vim is helpful as a backup plan. Related, I think it was cool to see that vim had a built in vimtutor module to learn and practice using vim.
