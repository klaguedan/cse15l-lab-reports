In this blog post, I will demonstrate 3 different cases each for 3 commonly used terminal commands: `cd`, `ls`, and `cat`. First we will examine (1) using the command without arguments, (2) using the command with a path to a directory/folder as its argument, and (3) using the command with a path to a file as its argument.

1. **cd:**
`cd` means to change directory or move to another folder.

* **... with no arguments**
   ```
   cd
   ```
   
* **... with a path to a _directory_ as an argument**
   ```
   cd lecture1/messages
   ```

* **... with a path to a _file_ as an argument**
   ```
   


2. **cd:**
`cd` means to change directory or move to another folder.

* **... with no arguments**
   ```
   ```
   
* **... with a path to a _directory_ as an argument**
* **... with a path to a _file_ as an argument**

3. **cd:**
`cd` means to change directory or move to another folder.

* **... with no arguments**
   ```
   ```
   
* **... with a path to a _directory_ as an argument**
* **... with a path to a _file_ as an argument**
